This project is programmed on:
  Arduino Mega Uno
  Raspberry Pi 3
Both working simultaneously, the former controlling motion of car and the latter processing track via image processing algorithms for track detection. 


To run the project codes you need to install the following:
1. Open CV (Link is  given)
2. Arduino IDE
3. NewPing and TinyGPS libraries for sensor and gps module (Given in libraries folder).
